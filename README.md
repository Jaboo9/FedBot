#### FEDBOT

------

FedBot is a simple bot I made for a class group I belong to, it's concept is pretty simple and straight forward. Created a Google form to capture member information, linked the Google form to a Google sheet, the bot uses a cron job to grab the data from the Google sheet using Google Sheet Api, checks for those who have birthdays for that day and pushes the information to a WhatsApp group using [WhatsMate API](https://www.whatsmate.net/) 

As a bonus, it also sends text messages to the individual using [BulkSMS API](https://www.bulksms.com/).

It was a quick one day hack, so might not have so many bells and whistles but I intend to explore more functionalities for the Bot.
